# Steam Games React Filter

This project was started with Create react app

## Reason for creating this project

This is my first finished project using react, that I used to improve my skills with react as well as my general design and css skills.

I also got to play around with the steam api which I'm hoping to use in future projects.

## Code Pen Example

An example of this code has been ported over to Codepen. [Click here to view on Codepen](https://codepen.io/liammyles/pen/MPYXJq)

## What's left to polish

This little project is done now, but there are always things that could still polished.

Here is a list of items that I would have liked to do, but didn't get around to:

- Add more group roles to the filters to improve the a11y of the component.
- Update the designs of the buttons.
- Create custom typography and better styled fonts.
- Improve the css to use less tag selectors.
- Port the css over to Sass.
- Make more generic classes for the component styles.
